## Usage
This project can be used as a base template for an e-commerce website or adapted for other types of websites. Since it's a frontend-only project, all interactions are simulated without real data or backend services.

- **Newsletter Modal**: A modal that prompts users to subscribe to a newsletter. This can be customized by modifying the HTML and CSS in the `index.html` and `styles.css` files.

## Configuration
You can customize the website by modifying the following files:

- **HTML (index.html)**: Modify the structure of the pages, add or remove elements, and customize modals, notifications, and menus.
- **CSS (styles.css)**: Change colors, fonts, and layouts. The CSS file includes custom properties for typography, colors, and transitions, making it easy to update styles globally.
  
  ```css
  :root {
    --salmon-pink: #ff8f9c;
    --eerie-black: hsl(0, 0%, 13%);
    --white: hsl(0, 100%, 100%);
    /* More color variables */
  }
  ```

- **JavaScript (script.js)**: All interactive features such as modal triggers, notification handling, and navigation toggles are managed through JavaScript. Functions are organized by feature, making it easy to adjust or extend functionality.

  ```javascript
  const modalCloseFunc = function () {
    modal.classList.add('closed');
  };
  ```

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are used in this project:
- **HTML5 and CSS3**: For the structure and styling of the website.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For interactivity and dynamic features.
- **[Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/)**: Icons used throughout the website (e.g., in the header, modals, and notifications).
- **Google Fonts - Poppins**: The font used for typography.

## Examples
- **Toast Notifications**: Toast notifications simulate product purchases with a sliding effect that appears and disappears after a set interval.
- **Newsletter Modal**: The modal prompts users to subscribe to a newsletter and can be closed via the 'X' button or by clicking outside the modal.

## Troubleshooting
- If the modal or navigation menus are not working, check for any console errors in your browserâ€™s developer tools. Ensure that `script.js` is properly linked in the `index.html`.
- If styles are not being applied, verify that the `styles.css` file is properly linked and there are no syntax errors.
